# Big picture

*Docker is a software platform used to create containerized applications. K8s automates the process of running
containerized*

## K8s Primer

*Cloud native app* - app build from small specialized components(usually containers) that is easy to scale and update
*Kubernetes* - is a platform of choice when it comes to running this could native apps

*Kubernetes cluster* is made of a bunch of linux nodes (VMs or cloud instances). Some of them form a control plane and
others the worker nodes.

*Control plane* - is a brain of the cluster. Composes: API server, scheduler, a bunch of controllers and persistent
storage (ectd)
*Workers* - Where you apps run

*YAML*  
You use YAML files to configure your K8s cluster and to change its *desired state*

## Control plane

API server, scheduler, a bunch of controllers and persistent

### ectd

*The only stateful part of control plane*

It is good for separation of concerns.
For a really big cluster you want to deploy a separate ectd cluster its own HA.

Note:
An *HA cluster with external etcd* is a topology where the distributed data storage cluster provided by etcd is external
to the cluster formed by the nodes that run control plane components.

### API server

*Central station of the control plane. **A place where everything in Kubernetes is defined***

* Exposes API and performs CRUD operations
* It is a REST-ful API that uses standard HTTP methods
* kubectl just posts our defined YAML files to the server through REST API

```text
> kubectl .... ------> Requests (POST YAML or text) to API server
```

#### API Groups

There are a bunch of API groups. The core API group is often referred to with empty quotes.

*SIGs (group of people)* look after API groups

```bash
> kubectl get appservices # for existing cluster get api services
```

## Kubernetes essentials

## K8s Objects

Each time we define in YAML kind and api we define a Kubernetes object

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
...
```

### Pod

*High level construct that contains one or more containers; Atomic unit of scheduling*

So K8s does not run containers directly, only via Pods

It is:

* The smallest thing you can run on K8s
* **Object on the cluster**
* Defined in the **v1** (core) **API group**

But pods of their own don't give us a great deal, so we wrap them in a high level object "Deployment"

### Deployment

*Needed to make pods scalable, rolling updates*

It is:

* again object on the cluster
* defined in **apps/v1 API group**

### DaemonSet (DS)

*One pod per node*

Ensures that only one and only one of the specific pod will run on every worker in the cluster

### Stateful sets

*Stateful app components*

Stateful sets for pods of parts of your application with particular stateful requirements

### Other parts

* Volumes
* Secrets
* Load balancers

### Demo app organisation

After mapping the architecture of demo app to K8s object we end up with the following structure:
