# Deployment

General structure:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: postgres-deploy  # DEPLOYMENT NAME
spec:
  replicas: 3 # AMOUNT OF DESIRED REPLICAS
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      <LABEL>: <pods_label_name> # SELECTOR FOR DEPLOYMENT
  template: # PODS DEFINITION
    matchLabels:
      <LABEL>: <pods_label_name> # LABEL ON THE PODS
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: ...
          name: ...
```

* You can get pods by label using: ```kubectl get pods -l <LABEL>```
* You can get pods by full selector using: ```kubectl get pods --selector <LABEL>=<pods_label_name>```

## Strategy (Rolling Update)

*Gradually replaces existing pods in the deployment with pods of newer version*

_NOTE_: If we just increase amount of replicas - that's not a rolling update. Rolling update in trigerred only if you
change section ```templates```.

Rolling Update is the default strategy for deployment. We can tune it with:

* ```Max Surge``` (максимальне зростання) - means that while we are performing an update we are allowed to create (
  surge) one. Can be percentage or values.
  more replica than is specified in desired state.
* ```Max Unavailable``` - sets how many replicas we can go below desired state. If 0 - means never go below desired
  state.

In spec ```minReadySeconds``` specifies how much time should pass between steps of Rolling Update. E.g. creation of a
new pod with RollingUpdate strategy (and deletion of the old one) and the next iteration of the same process. This is
needed to let the new pods stabilize, so they can perform before new ones created.

* You can get the status of current rollout by: ```kubectl rollout status deploy <deployment_name>```
* You can get the replica sets (that manage amount of pods): ```kubectl get rs -o wide```

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: postgres
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: postgres
  strategy: # STRATEGY DEFINITION
    rollingUpdate: # specify characteristics of the strategy called rollingUpdate
      maxSurge: 1 # can be percents also (e.g. 50%)
      maxUnavailable: 0
    type: rollingUpdate # TYPE OF DESIRED STRATEGY
  minReadySeconds: 300 # TIME BETWEEN STEPS OF ROLLING UPDATE
  template: # ROLLING UPDATE IS TRIGGERED ONLY IF THIS SECTION IS CHANGED
    matchLabels:
      ...
    spec:
      containers:
        - ...
```

#### History of rollouts

We can keep the history of rollouts with the detailed specification.

* To keep history of upgrades when applying config pass --record flag:
  ```kubectl apply -f <deployment_file>.yaml --record```.
* To get history of rollouts  ```kubectl rollout history deploy <deployment_name>```
* To get details on the specified revision with source YAML file and printed
  details: ```kubectl rollout history deploy <deployment_name> --revision <revision_id>```

#### Rollback

By having history of revisions you can roll back to the specified revision id or to previous state of deployment.

* Roll back to previous state: ```kubectl rollout undo deploy <deployment_name>```

*NOTE*: the best practise is to use *declarative* approach to any rollbacks as unexpected behaviour may occur. It means
new (same as previous) .YAML file should be created and posted with ```apply```.

## Labels

Deployment manages pods using Labels.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: postgres-deploy
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: postgres-pods # WHICH PODS THIS DEPLOYMENT SHOULD MANAGE
  template:
    matchLabels:
      app: postgres-pods # HOW TO LABEL PODS CREATE BY THIS DEPLOYMENT
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: ...
          name: ...
```
