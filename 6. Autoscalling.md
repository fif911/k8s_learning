# Autoscalling

There are 3 types of autoscalling:

* HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaling)
* Cluster autoscaller
* VPA (Vertical Pod Autoscalling)

## HPA

HPA defines when to bring more pods based on CPU usage

_NOTE_: HPA takes care only about scaling pods. But if all nodes are already full - it sets pods to *pending*. And when
there are pending nodes - _Cluster Autoscaller_ kicks in and scales amount of nodes.

We can
also [limit scaling](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/#example-limit-scale-down-rate)
up and down rates, so pods are not spun-up like crazy.

### Breakdown

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: acg-hpa
  namespace: acg-ns # resides in a namespaces
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: deploy_name # DEPLOYMENT TO SCALE
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 50 # KEEP CPU UTILIZATION 50% BELOW OF WHAT WAS REQUESTED
```

To allow HPA to make scaling rules we have to specify in **Deployment** how much CPU resources we allow each pod to
consume:

```yaml
# Default deployment config
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: deploy_name
...
# spec.template.spec
containers:
  - image: nginx:1.12
    name: nginx
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 1 # A HARD CEILING ON HOW MUCH CPU TIME THE CONTAINER CAN USE
      requests:
        cpu: 0.25 # WEIGHTING OF A LIMIT VALUE; This container can use 25% of the limit so 25% of 1 CPU unit (real or virtual)
```

_NOTE_: Limits and requests for CPU resources are measured in cpu units. In Kubernetes, 1 CPU unit is equivalent to **1
physical CPU core**, or **1 virtual core**, depending on whether the node is a physical host or a virtual machine
running inside a physical machine.
